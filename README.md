# SequelizedEmperorBurger
A follow up to the Emperor Burger site, now with Sequelize!

# Usage

Burger data is pulled from the hosted MySQL DB and Table, and displayed onto the page via handlebars. From there, users can alter the data by either submitting a burger to the menu or eating one of the burgers, setting said burger into the Retired section of the site.

# DB

In contrast the previous iteration, Emperor Burger II now uses two DB models to track users and burgers. As users create their burgers said burgers are now tied to the different users.

# Technology used

Burger Emperor was built using :

Javascript
JQuery
Bootstrap
MySQL
Sequelize
Handlebars
Flip.js
